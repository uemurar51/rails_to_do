- Ruby version: ruby 2.4.0p0 Rails version: Rails 5.0.1

- Running a MySQL Database to store records
  * mysql2 gem

- Steps to run:
  1. Clone directory to local computer
  2. cd into cloned directory
  3. "rails server" to start the RoR server
  4. In your browser go to "localhost:3000" as the URL
  5. You should now be in the application!
    * Note: I'm very new to Rails so I apologize if I forgot anything!

- Used a scaffold to generate initial todo list.

- One note: If you're trying to delete a to-do list, you must delete all of
  the to-do list items first before deleting the list. Did not sort out dependencies and constraints.
